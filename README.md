Theater schmeater
============

**A bite-sized Seattle theater house**

The website needed serious work, so here is my jab at it.
Work files found in src directory, css, js, and imgs found outside were generated with grunt plugins for webpage speediness
Used a bit of bootstrap to hamburger my navs, for glyphs and for the forms but otherwise the rest is my own. Especially note the scalability please, that took forever.
